# Hello, I am Kayla Rautenbach

I am currently part of the Dimension Data GAP 2020 program. 

I am 25 years old and I am from Underberg, KZN. I went to boarding school in Pietermaritzburg at The Wykeham Collegiate and I then went on to study at Stellenbosch University. I did a Bachelor of Science in Biodiversity and Ecology. 
 
After graduating, I went to Vietnam and taught English there for 18 months. I then found myself working at Londolozi Game Reserve for another 18 months in the hospitality industry. 
 
### More about me
 
My interests are diverse. I am passionate about animals and the outdoors and would like to give back to our world in some way “to make a difference.” I am excited about new challenges and am looking forward to being able to use my interpersonal skills and ability to contribute to the success of the institution that employs me. I am a well-balanced, calm individual with a great sense of loyalty to whatever I commit to. I consider myself to be organized, conscientious and a person of integrity. I am a hardworker and a good problem solver. I am eager to learn as much as possible this year and I would love to get involved in Connected Conservation.
