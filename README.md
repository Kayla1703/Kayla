# Hello, I am Kayla Rautenbach
## Welcome to my online CV

I am currently part of the Dimension Data GAP 2020 program. 

### More about me

 I am 25 years old and I grew up in Underberg, KZN. I went to boarding school in Pietermaritzburg at The Wykeham Collegiate and I then went on to study at Stellenbosch University. I did a Bachelor of Science in Biodiversity and Ecology. 
 
 After graduating, I went to Vietnam and taught English there for 18 months. I then found myself working at Londolozi Game Reserve for another 18 months in the hospitality industry. 

### Projects 

 We rotate throughout Dimension Data and we have already been in the Digital Advisory space, spent time with the Customer Experience Team and we have been through the Sales department. I look forward to what the rest of the year has in store, whether it be virtual or back at The Campus. 
 
### Goals

My interests are diverse. I am passionate about animals and the outdoors and would like to give back to our world in some way “to make a difference.” I am excited about new challenges and am looking forward to being able to use my interpersonal skills and ability to contribute to the success of the institution that employs me. I am a well-balanced, calm individual with a great sense of loyalty to whatever I commit to. I consider myself to be organized, conscientious and a person of integrity. 

 I am eager to learn as much as possible this year and in some way make a difference. I would love to get involved in Connected Conservation.
